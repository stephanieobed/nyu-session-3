# Session 3

Today we continue to work with NPM, responsive design and start looking at Expressjs - exploring some of its capabilities.

## Homework

* download this repo and review the steps below - try to get the communication between the form and mLab working. 
* do the Git / Github tutorial at [the Git Website](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* upload a finished version to github (remember to use a .gitignore file)

## Reading 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js#History

https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html

## NPM Review


Node-sass: https://github.com/sass/node-sass#command-line-interface
Browser-sync: https://www.browsersync.io/docs/command-line
Concurrently: https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently

* cd into session-3, install the dev-dependencies and run the script:

```bash
npm install
npm run boom!
```

## GIT and GITHUB

Since we've created a nice, reusable package.json we should save it for future use. 

Git - a version control system originally invented for use developing Linux by Linus Torvalds. It is the standard version tool and integrates with Github to permit collaboration.

There is a handy and very simple tutorial for Git on [the Git Website](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) which is highly recommended for those new to git and github.

1. make sure terminal is in the correct directory using `cd` (drag-and-drop, copy paste)
1. initialize the repo:

```bash
git init
```

Configuring Git for the first time - only if you haven't done this before:

```bash
git config
git config --global user.name " ***** "
git config --global user.email " ***** "
git config --list
```

* Add (watch) all your files:

```bash
git add .
```

Once you have made changes you need to commit them

```bash
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

Note: `git commit`  without the `-m` flag goes into VI - a text popular UNIX text editor. To avoid this always using the -m flag when committing. (If you end up in VI, hit ESC and type ‚Äú:q‚Äù to exit.)

* Git Status

```bash
git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

* Create a new branch:

```bash
git branch <new branchname>
git checkout <new branchname>
git branch
```

* merge branches:

* make sure the branch you want to merge is clear (`$ git status`)
* checkout the branch you want to merge into
* run status on that branch too (make sure it is clear)

```bash
git checkout master
git status
git merge <new branchname>
```

* delete branches:

```bash
git branch -d <branchname>
```

or (to delete an unmerged branch)

```bash
git branch -D <branchname>
```

Note: be sure to delete while *not* on the targeted branch

* pushing files to remote repos - Github

Note: always create a .gitignore file to prevent local working/utility files from being pushed e.g.:

```
.DS_store
node_modules
```

* Log into Github, create and new repo and follow the instructions e.g.:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<nameofgithubrepo>
git push -u origin master
```

Finally - when downloading a github repo use the `clone` method to move it to your local disk while retaining the git history and branches.


## Responsive Navigation continued

Move all nav related css into a new partial `_nav.scss` and import:

`@import "imports/nav";`


Nest and refactor the CSS rules for the nav:

```css
nav {
  display: flex;
  background: $link;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
  transition: all 0.5s;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1; 
  .fixed-nav & {
    position: fixed;
    box-shadow: 0 5px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); 
  }

  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
    display: flex;
    flex:1;
    min-height: 2.25rem;
  }

  li {
    flex: 1;
    text-align: center;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }

  a {
    text-decoration: none;
    display: inline-block;
    color: white;
  }
}

.logo {
  max-width:0;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: all 0.5s;
  img {
    padding-top: 0.25rem;
    width: 2rem;
    margin-left: 0.5rem;
  }
  .fixed-nav & {
    max-width:500px;
  }
}

```

Since we are using the logo as a hamburger a different strategy is needed.

```css
.logo {
  display: block;
  @media (min-width: $break-two){
    display: none;
  }
  // max-width:0;
  // overflow: hidden;
  // transition: all 0.5s;
}

// .fixed-nav .logo {
//   max-width:500px;
// }
```

```css
.logo img {
  padding-top: 0.25rem;
  width: 2rem;
  margin-left: 0.5rem;
}
```

Get the navigation to display vertically on small screens. 

Hide the nav-links initially on small screens while maintaining the flex display characteristics on wide:

```css
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
    flex:1;
    min-height: 2.25rem;
    display: none;
    @media (min-width: $break-two){
      display: flex;
    }
  }
```

Refactor to stack the list items and simplify:

```css
  li {
  padding: 1rem;
  @media (min-width: $break-two){
    flex: 1;
  }
}
```

Make clicking on the logo show the menu on narrow screens:

```js
const logo = document.querySelector('.logo');
logo.addEventListener('click', showMenu);

function showMenu(){
  document.body.classList.toggle('showmenu');
  event.preventDefault();
}
```

Add to `_nav.scss` using ampersand:

```css
    ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
    flex:1;
    min-height: 2.25rem;
    display: none;
    .showmenu & {
      display: block;
    }
    @media (min-width: $break-two){
      display: flex;
    }
  }
```

Hide the hamburger icon after a link has been clicked:

```js
window.onhashchange = function () {
  let newloc = window.location.hash;
  let newContent = navItems.filter(navItem => navItem.link == newloc);
  siteWrap.innerHTML = `
  <h1>${newContent[0].label}</h1>
  <h2>${newContent[0].header}</h2>
  <p>${newContent[0].content}</p>
  `;
  if (window.innerWidth <= 740){
    showMenu();
  }
}
```

* Reminder - use the meta tag `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` to ensure responsive design works on devices.


## Babel

Install the dependencies babel-cli and babel-preset-es2015 and add presets to package.json.

`$ npm install babel-cli --save-dev`

`$ npm install --save-dev babel-preset-es2015`

Note the documentation for [babel-cli](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/) and the message `üôå  Thanks for using Babel: we recommend using babel-preset-env now: please read babeljs.io/env to update!`

Add a babel script (note the output path references a min folder we need to create) and babel presets to package.json:

```js
{

  "scripts": {

    "babel": "babel app/js/main.js --watch --source-maps --out-file app/js/main-compiled.js",

  },

  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-cli": "^6.22.2",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.22.0",

  },
  "babel": {
    "presets": [
      "es2015"
    ]
  }
}

```

Mac: add babel to our concurrent commands:

```bash
"boom!": "concurrently \"npm run start\" \"npm run watch-node-sass\"  \"npm run babel\" "
```

and run `npm run boom!`

Note: PC / Mac users using VS Code for SASS transpiling and browser refresh need only run `npm run babel`

Don't forget to change the link to the main.js in index.html to point to the new file.

`<script src="js/main-compiled.js"></script>`



# NODE and Express JS

## NODE

A simple node.js [server](https://nodejs.org/en/about/). 

Note the use of const, template strings, arrow functions and the request and response variables.

DEMO: Save this as app.js in the project folder and run it using `node script.js`

```js
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

Note: we are running a node app using the `node` command in the terminal.


## Express

The server we are using (browser sync) won't cut it when it comes to all the features needed to develop a website with all the http services we will need.

Express is a framework for building web applications on Node.js. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node and allows you to use JavaScript as your server-side language.

Aside: Here is the [generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html). Note the directory structure and the use of [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) as a template tool. Here's a [Pug converter](http://www.html2jade.org). Note: Jade was renamed to Pug due to a software trademark claim.

Let's look at the canonical "Hello world" [example](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html).

Install express using npm `$ npm install --save express`

Edit `app.js` in the root folder of our project.

```js
const express = require('express') 
// require the npm library
const app = express() 
// create a var for the app to be built using express
// app is the global variable namespace for the program we are building
const port = 9000

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!')) // our first route

app.get('/watchlist', function(req, res){
  res.send(`
    <h1>Watchlist</h1>
    <p>Commentary on Watchlists will go here.</p>
    `)
})

app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}!`)
})
```

Run with `$ node app.js`

Note and test the routing above. 

Note that console.log is now using the terminal, *not* the browser's.

Note the [get](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) verb used in our [basic express route](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html).

Common web-development tasks are not directly supported by Node. If you want to add specific handling for different HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE, etc.), separately handle requests at different URL paths ("routes"), serve static files, or use templates to dynamically create the response, then you will need to write the code yourself, or use ExpressJS.

Add a second route that includes a variable:

```js
app.get('/entry/:name?', function(req, res){
  let name = req.params.name
  res.send(`
    <h1>${name}</h1>
    <p>Commentary on ${name} will go here.</p>
    `)
})
```

Test in the browser after restarting the node process.: `http://localhost:9000/entry/watchlist`.

Multiple parameters:

```js
app.get('/entry/:name?/:link?', function(req, res){
  let name = req.params.name
  let hashlink = `#${req.params.link}`
  res.send(`
    <h1>${name}</h1>
    <p>Commentary on ${name} will go here.</p>
    <p>${hashlink}
    `)
})
```

Test in the browser after restarting the node app: `http://localhost:9000/entry/watchlist/test`.

## Nodemon

We need to restart the server whenever we make a change to app.js. Let‚Äôs streamline it by using nodemon.

`$ npm install -save-dev nodemon`

To use nodemon we simply call it (instead of node) in the terminal with the name of our file:

`nodemon app.js`

We no longer need to restart our server after making changes. Nodemon will watch for changes and take care of that for us.

## Test Nodemon

Add this after the last route:

```
app.get('*', function(req, res){
  res.send(`
    <h1>Page not found</h1>
    `)
})
```

Upon save nodemon should restart the server.

## Express Middleware

[Middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html) is used extensively in Express apps in order to simplify common web development tasks like working with cookies, sessions, user authentication, accessing request POST and JSON data, logging, etc.

DEMO: We will eventually be using [static](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) middleware (the only middleware *built in* to Express) to serve files in our exercise.

Add to app.js (above the app.get... line):

```js
app.use(express.static('app'))
```

Note again that we have to stop and start the server whenever we change app.js.

Comment out `app.use(express.static('app'))` - we'll make use of this later.


## CRUD

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (using the http verbs POST, GET, PUT and DELETE respectively). This is what [each operation does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods):

* Read (GET) - Retrieve something, requests a representation of the specified resource
* Create (POST) - Make something, a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a data-handling process
* Update (PUT) - Alter an existing item, if the URL refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if not, then the server can create the resource with that URL
* Delete (DELETE)- deletes the specified resource.

As we have seen, in Express, we handle a GET request with the get method: 

`app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))`

The first argument, `/,` is the path of the GET request (anything that comes after your domain name). For localhost:3000, the browser is actually looking for localhost:3000/. The path argument in this case is /.

The second argument `(req, res) => res.send('Hello World!')` is a callback function that tells the server what to do when the path is matched. It takes in two arguments, a request object and a response object (req, res).

Let‚Äôs use the res object to serve an index.html page back to the browser. 

sendFile is a method that‚Äôs provided by the res object:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // console.log(__dirname)
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html')
})
```

`__dirname` is a global variable for the directory that contains the app.js. 

Create index.html in the top level:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Testing 1 2 3</p>
</body>
</html>
```

You should be able to see the HTML file in the browser at the specified port number.

## CRUD - CREATE
The CREATE operation is performed only by the browser if a POST request is sent to the server. This POST request can triggered either with JavaScript or through a <form> element.

Add the following to index.html

```html
<form action="/entries" method="POST">
  <input type="text" placeholder="label" name="label">
  <input type="text" placeholder="header" name="header">
  <textarea type="text" placeholder="content" name="content"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```html
<style>
  input, textarea {
    display: block;
    margin: 1rem;
    width: 70%;
</style>
```

Our form requires:

1. an action attribute
2. a method attribute
3. and name attributes on all <input> elements within the form

The action attribute tells the browser where to navigate to in our Express app. 

The method attribute tells the browser what to request to send. In this case, it‚Äôs a POST request.

On our server, we can handle this POST request with a post method that Express provides. It takes the same arguments as the GET method:

```js
app.post('/entries', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Hello')
})
```

Refresh your browser then enter something into your form element. You should  see 'Hello' in your command line.

Express doesn‚Äôt handle reading data from the <form> element on it‚Äôs own. We have to add a middleware package called body-parser to gain this functionality.

`$ npm install body-parser --save`

Make the following changes to app.js:

```js
const express = require('express')
const bodyParser= require('body-parser')
const app = express()
const port = 9000
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))
```

The urlencoded method within body-parser tells body-parser to extract data from the <form> element and add them to the body property in the request object.

Now, when you test your form, you should be able to see everything in the form field within the req.body object. Try doing a console.log:

```js
app.post('/entries', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body)
})
```

The object `{ label: '1', header: '2', content: '3' }` is packaged by the body parser and sent to the server as part of the request body.

## MongoDB

Express apps can use any database mechanism supported by Node including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.

We first have to install the driver for the popular NoSQL MongoDB through npm if we want to use it as our database.

`$ npm install mongodb --save`

Once installed, we can connect to MongoDB through the Mongo.Client‚Äòs connect method as shown in the sample code below:

```js
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/animals', function(err, db) {
  if (err) throw err;

  db.collection('mammals').find().toArray(function (err, result) {
    if (err) throw err;

    console.log(result);
  });
});
```

Let's start with:

```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient

MongoClient.connect('link-to-mongodb', (err, database) => {
  // ... start the server
})
```


The next part is to get the correct link to our database. For our first attempt we'll use a cloud service - [MongoLab](https://mlab.com).

Create a free account with MongoLab. Once you‚Äôre done, create a new MongoDB database and set the plan to sandbox (free) and call it bcl.

Once you‚Äôre done creating the deployment, click into it and create a database user and database password. 

![user](https://github.com/mean-spring-2017/session-3/blob/master/notes/mlab-user.png)
![user](https://github.com/mean-spring-2017/session-3/blob/master/notes/mlab-user2.jpg)

Remember these because you‚Äôre going to use it to connect the database you‚Äôve just created.

Finally, grab the MongoDB url and add it to your MongoClient.connect method. Make sure you use your database user and password!

`MongoClient.connect('mongodb://dannyboynyc:dd2345@ds139969.mlab.com:39969/bcl', (err, database) => {...}`

We want to start our servers only when the database is connected so let‚Äôs move app.listen into the connect method. We‚Äôre also going to create a db variable to allow us to use the database when we handle requests from the browser.

```js
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://dannyboynyc:dd2345@ds139969.mlab.com:39969/bcl', (err, database) => {
   if (err) return console.log(err)
    db = database
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening on port ${port}!`)
  })
})
```

We‚Äôre done setting up MongoDB. Start the server using `nodemon app.js` and make sure you don't get any errors.

Now, let‚Äôs create a collection - a named location to store data - to store content for our application.

We can create the collection by using the string `entries` while calling MongoDB‚Äôs db.collection() method. Since a collection is created if it doesn't already exist we can save our first entry into the database while using the `save` method.

Also, once we‚Äôre done saving, we have to redirect the user somewhere (or they‚Äôll be stuck waiting for our server to go the `/entries` which doesn't exist except as a post route). In this case, we‚Äôre going to redirect them back to `/`.

```js
app.post('/entries', (req, res) => {
  db.collection('entries').save(req.body, (err, result) => {
    if (err) return console.log(err)
    console.log('saved to database')
    res.redirect('/')
  })
})
```

Now enter something into the <form> element and you‚Äôll be able to see an entry in your MongoDB collection.

#### Showing entries to users

We have to do two things to show the entries stored in MongoLab to our users.

1. Get entries from MongoLab
2. Use a some form of dynamic html (a template engine) to display the entries

We can get the entries from MongoLab by using the find method that‚Äôs available in the collection method.

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  var cursor = db.collection('entries').find()
  console.log(cursor)
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html')
})
```

The find method returns a cursor (A Mongo Object) that probably doesn‚Äôt make much sense when you console.log it out.

Yet this cursor object contains all entries from our database. It also contains a bunch of other properties and methods that allow us to work with data easily. One such method is the toArray method.

The toArray method takes in a callback function that allows us to do stuff with entries we retrieved from MongoLab. Let‚Äôs try doing a console.log() for the results and see what we get!


```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  db.collection('entries').find().toArray((err, results) => {
    console.log(results)
    res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html')
  })
})
```

Refresh the page and see an array of entries in the terminal. 

Let's generate HTML that displays all our entries.

## Template Engines

http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html

We can‚Äôt serve our index.html file and expect entries to magically appear because there‚Äôs no way to add dynamic content to a plain HTML file. What we can do instead, is to use template engines to help us out. Some popular template engines include jade/pug, Embedded JavaScript and Nunjucks.

For today, we‚Äôre going to use Embedded JavaScript (ejs) as our template engine because it‚Äôs easy to start with.

We can use EJS by first installing it, then setting the view engine in Express to ejs.

`$ npm install ejs --save`

and in app.js:

`app.set('view engine', 'ejs')`

Let‚Äôs first create an index.ejs file within a views folder so we can start populating data.

```bash
mkdir views
touch views/index.ejs
```

Now, copy the contents of index.html into index.ejs and add.

```html
<div>
  <% for(let i=0; i<entries.length; i++) { %>
    <h2><%= entries[i].label %></h2>
    <p><%= entries[i].content %></p>
  <% } %>
</div>
```

In EJS, you can write JavaScript within <% and %> tags. You can also output JavaScript as strings if you use the <%= and %> tags.

Here, you can see that we‚Äôre basically looping through the entries array and creating strings with entries[i].label and entries[i].content.

The complete index.ejs file so far should be:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>MY APP</title>
  <style>
    input, textarea {
      display: block;
      margin: 1rem;
      width: 70%;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Testing 1 2 3</p>

  <form action="/entries" method="POST">
    <input type="text" placeholder="label" name="label">
    <input type="text" placeholder="header" name="header">
    <textarea type="text" placeholder="content" name="content"></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>

  <div>
    <% for(var i=0; i<entries.length; i++) { %>
    <h2><%= entries[i].label %></h2>
    <p><%= entries[i].content %></p>
    <% } %>
  </div>

</body>
</html>
```

Finally, we have to render this index.ejs file when handling the GET request. Here, we‚Äôre setting the results (an array) as the entries array we used in index.ejs above.


```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  db.collection('entries').find().toArray((err, result) => {
    if (err) return console.log(err)
    // renders index.ejs
    res.render('index.ejs', {entries: result})
  })
})
```

Now, refresh your browser and you should be able to see all entries.

## Integration with the old site

We need to move the old index.html into index.ejs and re-enable app.use static. 

We can edit our package.json to proxy the browser sync to our express port number and add nodemon to our list of currently running scripts.

```js
 "scripts": {
    "watch-node-sass": "node-sass --watch scss/styles.scss --output app/css/  --source-map true",
    "start": "browser-sync start --proxy 'localhost:9000' --browser \"google chrome\"  --files 'app'",
    "babel": "babel app/js/main.js --watch --source-maps --out-file app/js/main-compiled.js",
    "boom!": "concurrently \"nodemon app.js\" \"npm run start\" \"npm run watch-node-sass\" "
  },
```

You will have to comment out the onload function in order to see index.ejs:

```js
// window.onload = function () {
//   window.location.hash = '#watchlist' 
// }
```
